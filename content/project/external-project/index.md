We collabrate with [Dr. Edy Kim](https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/52376) on this project to understand the common pathogenic cell states between RA-ILD (RA-UIP and RA-nonUIP) and RA synovium, and the differences between RA-ILD and IPF (idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis) lung diseases using single-cell RNA-seq.
