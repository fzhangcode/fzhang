This is the first time that I had great chats with many rheumatologists and immunologists who are leaders from Japan, Europe, and China. 

I think [IFRA](https://fnih.org/what-we-do/programs/ifra2019) is definitely a great meeting, smaller size of ACR, worth attending to meet folks all over the world.

Next year the IFRA meeting will be held in Beijing, China. Hope there is a chance to attend it again!
