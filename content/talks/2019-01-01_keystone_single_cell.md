title: Oral talk: Integrating single-cell transcriptomics and mass cytometry to define cell states in rheumatoid arthritis at Single Cell Biology Keystone Symposia at Colorado
subtitle: single-cell integration
---

It was great to explore Breckenridge at Colorado - the best ski place!
Glad to give a 20 minutes talk about my work of
using single-cell trascriptomics and mass cytometry to identify
pathogenic cell states in rheumatoid arhtiritis.

Here is the [agenda](http://www.keystonesymposia.org/19L1) for more exciting talks!
