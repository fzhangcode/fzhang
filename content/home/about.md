# About me
I am a Computational Biologist working in [immunogenomics](https://immunogenomics.hms.harvard.edu/) with [Dr. Soumya Raychaudhuri](https://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/person/faculty/soumya-raychaudhuri) in collaboration with [Dr. Michael Brenner](https://www.hms.harvard.edu/dms/immunology/fac/Brenner.php) at Harvard Medical School, Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH), and Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT at Boston.
My research interests lie in the application of bioinformatics and statistics to study autoimmune diseases, medicine, and public health.
Recently, I focus on developing accurate and computationally scalable methods to study single-cell transcriptomics and proteomics to discover potential drug targets for rheumatic diseases.
I am also part of the Bioinformatics team of the BWH [10X Single Cell Genomics Core](https://singlecell.bwh.harvard.edu/).


I received my PhD in [bioinformatics and biomedical engineering at WPI](https://www.wpi.edu/academics/departments/biomedical-engineering) where I worked with [Dr. Patrick Flaherty](https://people.math.umass.edu/~flaherty/?_ga=2.161809467.684947861.1552584709-2039651767.1552584709) on Bayesian statistics and machine learning for large-scale genomic data.
I also worked with [Dr. Andrew C. Trapp](http://users.wpi.edu/~atrapp/) on developing global optimization algorithms to solve mixed membership models.
