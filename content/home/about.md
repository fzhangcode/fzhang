# About me

I am an research scientist working in [immunogenomics](https://immunogenomics.hms.harvard.edu/) with [Dr. Soumya Raychaudhuri](https://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/person/faculty/soumya-raychaudhuri) at Harvard Medical School, Brigham and Women's Hospital, and Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT at Boston.
My research interests lie in the application of bioinformatics and statistics to study autoimmune diseases, medicine, and public health.
I also work with [Dr. Michael Brenner](https://www.hms.harvard.edu/dms/immunology/fac/Brenner.php) from Brigham and Women's Hospital to investigate inflamed cell states in synovial tissue samples from rheumotoid arthritis and lupus patients. 
Recently, I focus on developing accurate and computationally scalable methods to study the single-cell genomics and genetics data to discover potential drug targets in autoimmune diseases.

I received my PhD in [bioinformatics and biomedical engineering at WPI](https://www.wpi.edu/academics/departments/biomedical-engineering) where I worked with [Dr. Patrick Flaherty](https://people.math.umass.edu/~flaherty/?_ga=2.161809467.684947861.1552584709-2039651767.1552584709) on Bayesian statistics and machine learning for large-scale genomic data.
I also worked with [Dr. Andrew Trapp](http://users.wpi.edu/~atrapp/) on developing global optimization algorithms to solve mixed membership models.
