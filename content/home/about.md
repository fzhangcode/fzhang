# About me
I am a Computational Biologist working in [immunogenomics](https://immunogenomics.hms.harvard.edu/) with [Dr. Soumya Raychaudhuri](https://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/person/faculty/soumya-raychaudhuri) in collaboration with [Dr. Michael Brenner](https://www.hms.harvard.edu/dms/immunology/fac/Brenner.php) at Harvard Medical School, Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH), and Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT (2017 - Present).
My research interests lie in the development and application of computational methods and pipelines to decipher pathogenic cell states and disease-associated features for autoimmune diseases using high-dimensional single-cell multi-omics data.
I have been collaborating with [Dr. Laura Donlin](https://www.donlinlab.com/) on pathologic mechanisms of macrophages in autoimmune diseased tissues.
I am also part of the BWH [10X Single Cell Genomics Core](https://singlecell.bwh.harvard.edu/), where I provide consulting on bioinformatics protocols to academic customers such as immunology, rheumatology, pulmonology, and pathology labs.



During my PhD (2013 - 2017), I worked with [Dr. Patrick Flaherty](https://people.math.umass.edu/~flaherty/) on Bayesian statistical modeling and machine learning for large-scale NGS-seq data to characterize patient heterogeneity in clinical samples.
I also worked with [Dr. Andrew C. Trapp](http://users.wpi.edu/~atrapp/) on developing global optimization algorithms to solve variations of mixed membership models.
